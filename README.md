# node-express-rest-api
Personal experiment to teach myself Express.js, making REST API's to query data and using ajax to display data.

## Fourth iteration
An (insecure, rudamentary & basic) login system with middleware to make sure unautharized users can not see any data. Logins get queried and checked with a users table on the database.
Also further improvements with the template engine has been made

## Third iteration
Using ajax to submit forms to avoid page refreshes and redirects

## Second iteration
Using views instead of local files and letting the server render the pages
- On home page: Using api call to fetch data and display it using ajax and jquery
- On details page: Using the route to send data and display them using ejs

## First iteration
Local files to query data and display them. Kinda hacked together
